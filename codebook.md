Data was loaded from a link from the class website:
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

The data came from UCI Machine Learning test on Samsung electronics using 30 subjects.  For the purposes of this exercise, we limited our
data to the output that contained mean or standard deviation and combined the test run with the training run.  There were a total of 
10299 observations between the two.


##ID columns:
The ID columns allow us to identify which test subject and activity was being conducted for each row
Col# ColName 
"1"  "subject": the subject is an identification column that identifies which of the 30 subjects was performing the test
"2"  "activity": the activity describes the activity the subject is perfoming (sample: walking)

#Data Columns
The data columns featured a subset containing the mean and standard deviation calls of the original data from the Samsung study.
Each contains the time and frequency domain of each of the given titles.  Columns with a leading t indicate time, while f indicates frequency.
Column titles with -mean() indicate that it is the mean of that column, while -std() indicates standard deviation.
